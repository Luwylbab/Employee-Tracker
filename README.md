# Employee Tracker

## Description

This repo contains the content for module 12

- I wanted to create a tool that could help a business keep track of its employees and their roles.
- The application can take a user's inputs to display tables containing information from the employee database.
- I learned more about about node, mysql, and running commands in the terminal.

## Installation

- Get SSH key from https://github.com/Luwylbab/Employee-Tracker

- Clone the repository using [git@github.com:Luwylbab/Employee-Tracker.git]

## Usage

When a user runs the node command in the terminal, a list of prompts will appear. From this list , the user is able to easily view employees, add employees, update employee roles, view roles, add roles, view departments, and add departments.
